ðŸ“Š **Model Development and Evaluation Process Summary:**
========================================

- Loaded the heart disease dataset and explored the distribution of key features.
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets, visualized the split.
- Applied standard scaling (z-score normalization) to continuous features for KNN and Logistic Regression.
- Trained and evaluated four classification models:
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [non-tree]
    - XGBoost Classifier [tree]
    - Random Forest Classifier [tree]
    - Logistic Regression [non-tree]
- Compared model accuracies via a bar plot.
- Visualized confusion matrices for all classifiers to assess prediction quality.
- XGBoost and Random Forest are tree-based models; KNN and Logistic Regression are non-tree-based.
- The process and results are visualized in the generated PNG files for inclusion in your report.
